# nonogram game

## Library used

JAVA processing library for drawing. Everything else is coded from scratch.

## How it works

The `convert.py` script will convert an image into a 2D array of binaries and outputs it into the `result.txt` file.
The `zoomValue` variable is tweeked along with the difficulty set in `game.pde` to be the exact same array length.

The game itself supports colors as well, not just black and white.
